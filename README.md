# ITLogger
This Project is an applcation inspired by my current day job. 
It will allow users to log into the site and log any IT issues they have and the admin will be able to see them in the order by most recent first. 

When a ticket is created, it is created via the form and goes into the database backend which is then accessed and will be displayed to the admin with the name of the person who created it, the subject and the message body. 

This is currently a early build but there will be more features added down the line.
